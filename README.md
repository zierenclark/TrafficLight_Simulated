# TrafficLight_Simulated
Goal: Design Logic Circuit that could be used for a traffic light and simulate circuit within Logism and Verilog code.

I was tasked with creating a traffic light Finite State Machine (FSM). Beginning with the FSM diagram, I mapped out light states and transitions. Using truth tables, I derived boolean equations to construct the logic circuit, ensuring the lights respond accurately to various input scenarios.

Proceeded to build the traffic light circuit in Logisim. I implemented the logic gates and connections based on the boolean expressions. Following the construction, I thoroughly tested the circuit by simulating different input scenarios to verify that the traffic lights transitioned correctly between states, ensuring the system's reliability and accuracy.
