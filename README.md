# TrafficLight_Simulated
Goal: Design Logic Circuit that could be used for a traffic light and simulate circuit within Logism and Verilog code.

I was tasked with creating a traffic light Finite State Machine (FSM). Beginning with the FSM diagram, I mapped out light states and transitions. Using truth tables, I derived boolean equations to construct the logic circuit, ensuring the lights respond accurately to various input scenarios.

Proceeded to build the traffic light circuit in Logisim. I implemented the logic gates and connections based on the boolean expressions. Following the construction, I thoroughly tested the circuit by simulating different input scenarios to verify that the traffic lights transitioned correctly between states, ensuring the system's reliability and accuracy.

Using Verilog's hardware description language, I defined the logic gates, state transitions, and input conditions. I then simulated and tested the Verilog code, assessing the circuit's functionality under various scenarios to ensure accurate and reliable behavior in different states.

 I connected the components on the trainer board, placing resistors, transistors, and other necessary elements to represent the logic gates and transitions. Following the circuit diagram, I configured the trainer suitcase to simulate the behavior of the traffic light system. After the physical assembly, I tested the circuit in real-life conditions, ensuring that the traffic lights responded accurately to various input scenarios and transitions.
